Revision history for Perl extension XTM.

0.34  Sun Aug  4 21:32:45 EST 2002
	- added LTM/CParser (would not build automatically on some systems?)
	- more speed improvements in XTM::Memory (topics query)
	- fixed documentation bug for induced_topic_tree
	- added class-instance as special association type to induced_topic_tree
	- added loop support (via shared trees) in induced_topic_tree, pruning reduces runtime
	- added some PSIs to XTM::PSI
	- added method descriptions to the most important base classes

0.33  Fri Jul 26 21:35:17 EST 2002
	- fixed bug which raises exception when XTM::Path creating /topic[@id = '...']
	- changed simple search syntax in XTM::Memory 'regexp' -> 'regexps'
	- added commands 'merge', 'duplicate_suppression', 'follow_maps' to xtm.pl
	- added consistency to be passed through all sync_ins also through XTM::Virtual
	- added t/08topic.t for simple tests
	- added 'is-reified-by' clauses in AsTMa (XTM::AsTMa::Parser) for topics and associations
	- added AsTMa directive auto_complete
	- added AsTMa directive encoding to occur several times in a document
	- added first (still experimental) version of LTM parsing, see XTM::LTM
	- fixed strange 'cannot add to undefined' error in XTM::Path when using XTM::Path::create and find inside one program (workaround, not solved yet)
	- allowed several scope topics for an association (follows XTM and LTM)
	- added caching to XTM::Path, already parsed expressions are cached
	- added variable to XTM::Path (similar to SQL prepare/expecute)
	- added method add_defaults to XTM::topic to add default type/scope to topic components if missing
	- modified Memory, generic for major performance improvements when merging (still some potential to be used)
	- modified Memory: merging dies if a topic is merged with an existing but both have a
	     different addressable resource
	- fixed bug in XTM::Path not detecting correctly strings '0'

0.32  Sun Jun 30 20:36:01 EST 2002
	- added XTM::grammar, a package to hold element dependencies and nesting (internal mainly)
	- added XTM::Path, XPath-like navigation through XTM::base data structures
	- XTM::Memory::id: setting of id added
	- XTM::topic, doc corrections
	- using a precompiled version of the Parse::Recdescent (considerable AsTMa= speedup)
	- fixed potential problems in XTM::generic
	- added merging code to XTM::Memory, is controlled via a hash in XTM constructor (BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY?)
	- fixed docu/code mismatch in XTM::topic (occurrences)
	- added scope_eq to XTM::scope
	- added canonicalize to XTM::topic (removes duplicates, sorts things)
	- added more query clauses for the simple query language in XTM::Memory
	- more directives for XTM::AsTMa (naming, encoding). Use with care.

0.31  Thu May 16 16:56:40 EST 2002
	- got rid of XTM::XML::ParseError and used XML::SAX::Exception instead	

0.30  Wed May  8 17:50:02 EST 2002
	- removed dependency of File::Slurp (weird version number), reported by az
	- fixed bug in incorrectly reporting line numbers in AsTMa::Parser, reported by az
	- various documention bugs fixed (still much to do)
	- astma2xtm.pl: some minor changes in switches (see man page)
	- AsTMa parser: local comments MUST have at least one blank before the '#' (see docs, may break some maps, sorry)
	- activated tests (old XML::LibXML core dump error has disappeared)
