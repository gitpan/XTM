XTM::base
---------

This base package contains Perl extension interfaces for Topic Maps

   http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/1.0/

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, and
exercise the usual incantation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

You will need perl version 5.6.1 or better to install these modules.

You will find an overview in XTM::base, further documentation is embedded 
in the individual modules.
