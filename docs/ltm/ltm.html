<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
This technical report defines version 1.2 of the Linear Topic Map
Notation, also known as LTM.  It provides both an introduction and a
formal definition, the latter in the form of a complete EBNF
specification given at the end of the document.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this document is not a formal specification from any
recognized standards body, but a Technical Report published by <a href="http://www.ontopia.net">Ontopia</a>, a commercial company,
for the convenience of all interested parties. The specification may
be taken up by some standards body at some point, but nothing suggests
that this will happen soon.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.2 extends version 1.1 to provide support for reifying the
topic map itself, specifying a base URI for the topic map, merging in
external topic maps, and specifying scope on occurrences and
associations. Some other minor simplifications and improvements to the
syntax have also been made.
</p>

<p>
Version 1.2 is <em>not</em> completely backwards
compatible with versions 1.1 and 1.0. One change has been made: scope
must now be specified <em>after</em> the base name rather
than in front of it, as before. This change was made to make scope on
base names consistent with that on associations and occurrences.
Colons are also no longer allowed in topic IDs, in order to avoid
problems when users write <tt>related-to(a: b, c: d)</tt>,
since the colon here is ambiguous.

<h2>
<a name="N60">1. Linear topic map notation? What's that?</a>
</h2>

<p>
The linear topic map notation is a simple textual format for topic
maps. Just like the XML interchange format it represents the
constructs in the topic map standard as text, but unlike the XML
format it is compact and simple. The notation can be written in any
text editor and processed by topic map software that supports it, or
converted into the XML format supported by such software.
</p>

<p>
The XML-based topic map interchange format is defined in such a way as
to make it easy to comprehend for humans and to develop software for,
and these purposes it fulfills very well.  However, this benefit has
been realized at the cost of making it awkward to read and write for
humans.  Now, humans were not really intended to do this, they were
intended to use specialized topic map editors, which would insulate
their users from the syntactical details of the interchange format.
</p>

<p>
However, there is still a need for a simple textual format that can be
used to concisely and clearly express topic map constructs in emails,
discussions and similar contexts. Such a format also makes it easy to
quickly create and maintain small topic maps for demonstration and
personal purposes. This is useful while we wait for good topic map
editors to be developed.
</p>

<p>
While you may find that this syntax provides you with a convenient and
easy way to maintain your topic maps, please note that the only
standardized forms for interchangeable topic maps remain the XTM 1.0
and HyTM syntaxes.
</p>

<p>
This notation has been developed by Ontopia.  Steve Pepper came up
with the original idea, based on the linear notation for conceptual
graphs. The notation has since been refined by Lars Marius Garshol,
with input from Geir Ove Gr&oslash;nmo and Steve Pepper. Useful contributions
from Murray Altheim and Akio Yamamoto are also gratefully acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
While the copyright to both this description and the format itself is
held by Ontopia Ontopia reserves <em>only</em> the right
to be recognized as the originator of the notation.  Permission to use
it in any way for any purpose whatsoever is hereby granted in
perpetuity to all potential users.
</p>


<h2>
<a name="N87">2. An introduction to the notation</a>
</h2>


<h3>
<a name="N92">2.1. Defining topics</a>
</h3>

<p>
The basis of the notation is the ability to define topics, which is
done by writing the ID of the topic in square brackets. An example is
shown below.
</p>

<pre>
[ltm]
</pre>

<p>
This represents a topic map consisting of a single topic that has the
ID 'ltm', but no other characteristics.  If you want, you can provide
it with a base name and a sort name as well, as in the example below.
Note that the sort name is optional.
</p>

<pre>
[ltm = "The linear topic map notation";
       "linear topic map notation, the"]
</pre>

<p>
You can even add a display name, if you want.  If you have a display
name the sort name is optional, but you need two semicolons to tell
the parser that the second name is a display name and not a sort name.
The example below shows a topic with all three name types.
</p>

<pre>
[foo = "basename"; "sortname"; "dispname"]
</pre>

<p>
The topic can also be typed. The example below adds the type 'format'
to the <tt class="symbol">ltm</tt> topic. Multiple type IDs can be listed
after the colon, separated by whitespace, if the topic has more than
just one type.
</p>

<pre>
[ltm : format = "The linear topic map notation";
                "linear topic map notation, the"]
</pre>

<p>
Note that even if no topic with the ID 'format' is defined anywhere in
the LTM file this reference will cause the topic to be created by the
LTM processor. The 'format' topic will have an ID, but no other
characteristics.  Note also that LTM is oblivious to whitespace.  You
can add as much whitespace as you want anywhere (except inside
strings) without having any effect on the resulting topic map.
</p>

<p>
LTM also supports providing subject indicators for topics, as shown
below. The URL of the subject indicator is quoted and preceded by an
'@' character. Any number of subject indicators can be given.
</p>

<pre>
[ltm : format = "The linear topic map notation";
                "linear topic map notation, the"
     @"http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"]
</pre>

<p>
For topics which represent network-retrievable resources it is not
necessary to use a proxy resource (a subject indicator) to indicate
the identity of the subject; it can instead be referred to directly.
LTM supports this, by using a '%' character followed by the quoted URL
of the resource. An example is shown below.
</p>

<pre>
[xmlspec : specification = "The XML 1.0 specification"
     %"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml"]
</pre>

<p>
The final construct supported by LTM for topics is scoping of names.
This can be done for the base name, sortname, dispname-trinity as a
whole, by appending a topic ID preceded by a slash after the name, as
shown below. Multiple topic IDs are allowed, separated by whitespace.
</p>

<pre>
[ltm : format = "Den line&aelig;re topic map-notasjonen";
                "line&aelig;re topic map-notasjonen, den"
                / norwegian 
     @"http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"]
</pre>

<p>
Note that if this example and the previous <tt class="symbol">[ltm]</tt>
example were to appear in the same LTM file it would cause a single
topic to be created with the union of the characteristics of these two
definitions. That means that the topic would have the 'ltm' ID, the
format type, the two different name sets and the given subject
indicator.
</p>

<p>
Note also that there are no requirements on the order in which
constructs appear in LTM files.  A topic type can be used before it is
defined, for example.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N155">2.2. Defining associations</a>
</h3>


<p>
The LTM notation also supports defining associations. In the example
below the LTM topic defined above is associated with a topic with the
ID 'topic maps' by an association that has the
<tt class="symbol">format-for</tt> type. ('format-for' is of course the ID of
the topic that types that association.)
</p>

<pre>
format-for(ltm, topic-maps)
</pre>

<p>
The meaning of this example is that LTM is a serialization format for
topic maps.  This should perhaps be made clearer by adding association
role types. The example below does this.
</p>

<pre>
format-for(ltm : format, topic-maps : standard)
</pre>

<p>
Note that if the association role type is omitted the role type will
default to the type of the topic. The rationale for this is that it is
a useful shorthand for a commonly occurring construction.
</p>

<p>
As a shorthand it is allowed to specify a topic in the role player
position, instead of just referencing it. All the constructs used when
defining topics can be used here, which means that it is possible to
define topics with their characteristics in the associations they
participate in without defining them anywhere else. The example could
therefore also have been written as follows.
</p>

<pre>
format-for(ltm, [topic-maps : standard = "Topic maps"])
</pre>

<p>
Associations can also be scoped, as with base names, by appending
a slash followed by the IDs of the scoping topics, separated by
whitespace. The example below illustrates this.
</p>

<pre>
[lmg : person = "Lars Marius Garshol"

format-for([ltm] : format, [topic-maps] : standard) / lmg
</pre>


<h3>
<a name="N191">2.3. Defining occurrences</a>
</h3>


<p>
LTM also supports defining occurrences.  This is done using the
notation shown below, where the occurrence information is given in
curly braces.  Three pieces of information, all of which are required,
appear inside the braces, separated by commas.  The first is the ID
of the topic which has the occurrence, the second is the ID of the
occurrence role type and the third is the locator of the occurrence in
double quotes.
</p>

<pre>
{ltm, specification, "http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"}
</pre>

<p>
You can also specify thr resource data of an occurrence inline in the
LTM file, as shown below.
</p>

<pre>
{ltm, description, [[A simple text-based format for topic maps.]]}
</pre>

<p>
Occurrences are scoped in the same way as associations:
</p>

<pre>
{ltm, specification, "http://www.ontopia.net/download/ltm.html"} / english
</pre>


<h3>
<a name="N215">2.4. A complete example</a>
</h3>


<p>
Below is given a more complete example of an LTM topic map.  Note that
text appearing between '/*' and '*/' is comments.
</p>

<pre>

[format       = "Format"]
[standard     = "Standard"]
[organization = "Organization"]

/* association types */

[format-for = "Format for"]
[defined-by = "Defined by"]

</pre>


<h3>
<a name="N227">2.5. Directives</a>
</h3>


<p>
LTM has a concept of so-called "syntax directives", which are used not
to represent topic map constructs, but to provide information related
to processing. There are three different directives, each covered in a
separate section below.
</p>

<h4>
<a name="N235">2.5.1. The TOPICMAP directive</a>
</h4>


<p>
The <tt class="symbol">TOPICMAP</tt> directive is used to make it possible to
reify the topic map itself. This is useful, since it makes it possible
to attach metadata to the topic map using topic map constructs. Below
is shown an example of the directive in use.
</p>

<pre>
#TOPICMAP example

[tm-topic = "An example topic map"
 @"#example"]
</pre>

<p>
To phrase it in XTM terms, this is like having a
<tt class="symbol">topicMap</tt> element with its <tt class="symbol">id</tt> set to
<tt class="symbol">example</tt>, and a topic with a subject indicator that
refers to that element.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is an error for a topic to be given the same ID as the
topic map itself.
</p>


<h4>
<a name="N268">2.5.2. The MERGEMAP directive</a>
</h4>


<p>
The <tt class="symbol">MERGEMAP</tt> directive is used to merge external
topic maps into the LTM topic map. The external topic maps can be in
any syntax, but if this syntax is not LTM it must be declared what
syntax it is. An example is shown below.
</p>

<pre>
#MERGEMAP "geography.xtm" "xtm"
</pre>

<p>
This directive causes the topic map at the given URI to be loaded
according to the rules of the syntax it is written in and merged with
the current topic map once the loading is complete. Note that the URI
is allowed to use any URI scheme, although there is no guarantee that
an LTM processor will understand any URI schemes beyond 'file'.
</p>

<p>
LTM processors are required to recognize the syntaxes listed below,
but not necessarily to support them. XTM and LTM must be supported,
while the other syntaxes are optional. It is an error if the LTM
processor is asked to merge in a topic map in a syntax it does not
understand. Note that the syntax names are case-insensitive. If no
syntax is specified, the default is LTM.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>xtm</dt>
<dd>The XTM 1.0 XML topic maps syntax.</dd>
<dt>hytm</dt>
<dd>The HyTime-based architectural form syntax defined in
the original ISO 13250 standard.</dd>
<dt>ltm</dt>
<dd>The Linear Topic Map Notation.</dd>
<dt>astma</dt>
<dd>The textual syntax for topic maps known as
<a href="http://topicmaps.bond.edu.au/astma/astma=.html">AsTMa=</a>.
</dd>
</dl>


<h4>
<a name="N341">2.5.3. The BASEURI directive</a>
</h4>


<p>
This directive is used to change the base URI against which relative
URIs in the document are resolved. It works exactly like the
<tt class="symbol">xml:base</tt> attribute in XML Base, or the
<tt class="symbol">BASE</tt> element in HTML. Below is shown an example.
</p>

<pre>
#BASEURI "http://www.ontopia.net/"
</pre>

<p>
All URIs occurring <em>after</em> the directive will
resolve against the given URI, which must be absolute, rather than
against the URI of the LTM document itself. This applies to URIs in
<tt class="symbol">MERGEMAP</tt> directives, subject addresses, subject
indicators, and the URIs of occurrences. (More formally, it applies to
all instances of the grammar symbol <tt class="symbol">uri</tt>.) Note that
the <tt class="symbol">BASEURI</tt> directive does not apply inside any files
included with <tt class="symbol">MERGEMAP</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Note that having more than one <tt class="symbol">BASEURI</tt> directive in
the same file is an error.
</p>




<h2>
<a name="N385">3. Formal syntax definition</a>
</h2>


<p>
This section defines the LTM syntax using a formal extended BNF
grammar. Lexical tokens are given either as single-quoted strings
directly in the grammar, or as upper-case names of token types.  The
token types are defined separately further below.
</p>

<pre>
  topic-map  ::= encoding? directive* (topic | assoc | occur) +

  encoding   ::= '@' STRING

  directive  ::= topicmapid | mergemap | baseuri

  topicmapid ::= '#' 'TOPICMAP' WS NAME

  mergemap   ::= '#' 'MERGEMAP WS uri WS STRING

  baseuri    ::= '#' 'BASEURI' WS uri
	     
  topic      ::= '[' NAME (WS ':' NAME+)? (topname)* subject? indicator* ']'

  subject    ::= '%' uri

  indicator  ::= '@' uri

  topname    ::= '=' basename ((';' sortname) |
                               (';' sortname? ';' dispname))?
                     scope?

  scope      ::= '/' NAME+

  basename   ::= STRING

  sortname   ::= STRING

  dispname   ::= STRING

  assoc      ::= NAME '(' assoc-role (',' assoc-role)*  ')' scope?
	     
  assoc-role ::= (topic | NAME) (':' NAME )?
	     
  occur      ::= '{' occ-topic ',' occ-type ',' resource '}' scope?

  resource   ::= uri | DATA

  occ-topic  ::= NAME

  occ-type   ::= NAME

  uri        ::= STRING
</pre>

<p>
The lexical token types defined below use Perl-style regular
expressions for their definitions.  Note that while whitespace
(represented by the <tt class="symbol">WS</tt> token type) is implicitly
allowed between any two tokens, it is explicitly required in the
'topic' production in the above grammar.  This is to avoid problems
caused by the fact that a colon is allowed in topic IDs.
</p>

<pre>
  NAME       = [A-Za-z_][-A-Za-z_0-9.]*
 	     
  COMMENT    = /\*([^*]|\*[^/])*\*/
	     
  STRING     = "[^"]*"

  DATA       = \[\[(([^&gt;]+&gt;)*|\])\]

  WS         = [\r\n\t ]+
</pre>

<p>
The <tt class="symbol">NAME</tt> token type is slightly modified compared to
the definition in the XML recommendation.  The colon is no longer
allowed as a name start character, since otherwise a single colon
could be both a name and a separator.
</p>

<p>
All tokens are case-sensitive.
</p>

<h3>
<a name="N414">3.1. Character encoding handling</a>
</h3>


<p>
All LTM files are to be processed <em>as if</em> they were
composed of Unicode characters. Files may be in any encoding, but if
that encoding is not ISO 8859-1 it should be declared using the
<tt class="symbol">encoding</tt> production. If the encoding declaration
appears in the file it must appear at the very beginning.  Support for
this construct is optional, but all processors must allow it to be
present and at least ignore it.
</p>

<p>
The encoding names used are those defined by IANA, which are the same
as those used by XML. The IANA character encoding identifier registry
can be found at <a href="http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets">http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/character-sets</a>.
</p>

<p>
Below is shown a simple example of an LTM file that uses the UTF-8
character encoding.
</p>

<pre>
@"utf-8"

[grove : person = "Geir Ove Gr&Atilde;&cedil;nmo"]
</pre>

<p>
(The name is of course Geir Ove Gr&oslash;nmo, encoded in UTF-8, but viewed
as if it were ISO 8859-1.)
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N445">3.2. Processing and references</a>
</h3>

<p>
Any topic referred to by its ID in an LTM file is considered to exist,
even if it is never defined anywhere by an explicit occurrence of the
<tt class="symbol">topic</tt> production with that topic. All occurrences of
the same topic ID are considered to be references to the same topic.
</p>

<p>
When an instance of the <tt class="symbol">topic</tt> production is found,
and a topic with the same ID has already been found, the two topic
definitions are merged as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The types of the resulting topic are considered to be the union
of the types found in each definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The names of the resulting topic are considered to be the union
of the names found in each definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The subject indicators of the resulting topic are considered to
be the union of the subject indicators found in each
definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than one subject address for the topic is found, the one
occurring last in the file is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If two topic definitions are found which have different topic IDs, but
in which the same name occurs in the same scope, no specific behaviour
is guaranteed. Possible results are that the topics may be merged,
that they may remain distinct and that an error may be signalled.  The
behaviour for topics with equal subject addresses or subject
indicators but different IDs is subject to the same unpredictability.
</p>


<h3>
<a name="N493">3.3. Completeness</a>
</h3>


<p>
The following topic map constructs from ISO 13250 and XTM 1.0 are not
supported:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Base names cannot have other variant names that display and sort
names, nor can any of these be anything but strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facets. Facets are in any case a HyTM feature only, and given
the concepts of subject adresses and subject indicators introduced in
XTM 1.0 they are now obsolete. They will therefore not be supported by
LTM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mnemonic string alternatives to types on various constructs.
These only exist in the HyTM syntax, and are really only a HyTime
legacy, with no model impact. They are therefore not really part of
topic maps per se.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reification of base names, occurrences, associations, and
association roles is not possible with the current syntax. This may be
supported in a later version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
